# Software Load Testing Tools

## Things to Look for when Choosing a Tool

Local Versus Commercial
- If your company already has a license for LoadRunner for example, that is the tool that you'll want to use. Or you might want to pick up an open source tool to begin with.

Local versus Cloud
- Are you expecting to run all of your tests within your local network or are you outsourcing it to some kind of cloud provider that's going to do the running of the tests and give you a report.

UI vs Script
- Are you more comfortable with tools that have a UI or are you okay with writing a script for your tool in pure code? Something like JMeter which has a graphical interface might be better for somebody who's not as familiar with coding. 

Integration with other development tools
- If you're in a Visual Studio environment, then it makes sense to use the Visual Studio load testing tool that's available.
