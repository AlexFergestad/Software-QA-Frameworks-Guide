# CI/CD What is It

## CI/CD is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.

## SO why are these practices becoming so popular these days? What benefits do they provide?

One of the key benefits of CI/CD is that technical problems are detected as early as possible instead of being identified just before a scheduled release.

If code is built just before the release, we run a higher risk of experiencing last-minute failures or issues.

By frequently integrating changes from different teams and building an integrated code base on a regular basis we reduce risk.

Effective practices and processes for building software increases team confidence in the integrity of the product.

This process of building, testing, and deploying software frequently reduces the time needed to resolve issues and improves the quality of code.

Because the software is fully built, tested, and automated with continuous builds, the effective product Time To Market (TTM) is reduced.

All builds should have a systematic revision number allowing one to track a particular commit version and its associated code. This is incredibly helpful when troubleshooting problems.

Over time, CI/CD processes can compile quality metrics for a targeted code base and generate product statistics and trend analysis reports for use as needed.
