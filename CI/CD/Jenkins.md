## What is Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source tool built in Java that enables teams to perform continuous integration and continuous deployment activities, regardless of the platform used. Jenkins offers a vast plugin ecosystem to extend its functionality and usability. Most plugins are extensible and we can also customize plugins the way we want.
